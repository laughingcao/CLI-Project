# CLI-Project

This is my CLI Project for Flatiron.

I use to work as a bartender until Covid-19. So I thought I would show some love to the 50 best bars of 2020.
It's pretty big deal in the bar world and it's a worldwide award.

https://www.worlds50bestbars.com/list/1-50

So I'm scraping data from this website using Nokogiri.
I created a command line interface for the user to select a bar by selecting their rank and the selected rank
will gives the user the bar's name, location, and the world's 50 best bars url for the bar.
